The data associated with a given issue follows the given structure:
- individual KPIs mapped to issues (focus area of research)
- issues mapped to themes, themes mapped to E, S, G pillars

Each KPI can be one of the following types of metrics:
- continuous series
- binary (policy focused)
- discrete scores (focused on severity)

The first iteration of the analysis will focus just on the continious-type KPIs, but will explore the introduction of binary and other discrete metrics later on.

Preliminary issue in focus will be within the human capital management space. 

**Update September 23, 2022:**

Focusing on causal modeling to determine the dependent relationship between variables common to a single issue. The overall objective is to determine a systematic framework the can provide a more informed view into how to combine the underlying metrics to create an aggregate issue score. The approach would be based on the results of conditional independence tests, regressions, and correlation-based analyses. 

Ultimately, the goal would be first to get a better understanding of the relationship between data points within a given theme (which can in turn provide a greater level of transparency to clients and ratings creations). Secondly, the framework would help provide a scalable solution to creating more granular issue ratings.
