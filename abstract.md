**Problem Statement:**

In finance, ESG has gained more and more momentum with clients increasing their expectations of investment managers that can help achieve certain sustainability or other ESG-related objectives. While ESG has become more popular, some asset knowns are making their goals more precise when it comes to whether they relate to E (Environment), S (Social), or G (Governance). As the types of areas that investors and asset owners want to conceptually target, defining such a topic in terms of the available data can be challenging without the knowledge of which data point, or points, can best achieve the objective/target in question. Therefore, a framework that help inform the composition or definition of a theme in terms of data is needed.

An example: If a client is determined to target companies that produce excessive amounts of pollution & waste, what would be the best combination of metrics such as the amount of hazardous waste they create, non-recyclable waste, or different intensity metrics related to harmful emissions. 

**Objective of Proposed Research:**
The ultimate objective of the research would be create a framework, based on causal discovery and modeling, that could inform the weighting of possible data points related to a specific theme. The goal would be to create a framework that is theme-agnostic so that it can be leveraged for themes across the E, S, and G pillars without imposing prior knowledge on the onset of the definition of the theme. 

An example:
Theme: Pollution & Waste
Related data points: hazardous waste, non-recyclable waste, hazardous emissions
Hypothetical Output: Based on the framework created, the informed combination of possible data points to define the theme of "pollution & waste" is 65% hazardous waste, 18% non-recyclable waste, and the remaining 17% equally distributed across the specific hazardous emission intensity metrics.
