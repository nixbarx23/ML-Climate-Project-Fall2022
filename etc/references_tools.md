The CauseMe platform provides ground truth benchmark datasets featuring different real data challenges to assess and compare the performance of causal discovery methods. The available benchmark datasets are either generated from synthetic models mimicking real challenges, or are real world data sets where the causal structure is known with high confidence. The datasets vary in dimensionality, complexity and sophistication.
